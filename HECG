The Hydro Electric Core Generator (HECG) is a new and advanced system that uses water-pressure cycle to generate electricity with producing any toxic byproducts. This solution is scalable, flexible, cost effective, and aligns with 6 sustainable development goals, SDG 3, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13.
This innovation solves the issue of greenhouse gas emissions, global warming, and climate change. This project would also tackle the issues of environmental and health hazards caused by combustion engines, and would also boost a country's economy by reducing the dependence on fossil fuels.
